# Breast-Cancer-Classification

The aim of this course project is to explore and compare characteristics of different classifiers (logistic regression, KNN, Gaussian Bayes, SVM, etc.).

Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set was obtained from UCI machine learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)
